consensus/accounts: Use a database view to compute the needed data

Uses a materialized view to periodically compute the view needed for
consensus/accounts endpoint. With this change, the account list now
sorted by total balance (balance + outgoing delegations + 
outgoing debonding delegations). Additionally the endpoint now returns
the outgoing delegations data for each acount, which was previously
omitted.

Additionally removes unneeded filters for consensus/accounts endpoint.

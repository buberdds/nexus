post-reindex fixes

This PR combines several minor fixes that were applied during
the reindex of production.

1. Damask-style proposals are now unmarshalled correctly
2. Cobalt PVSS txs are now unmarshalled correctly using vendored
oasis-core types.
3. TakeEscrow events are now indexed properly.
4. minor bump in oapi-codegen version to v1.12. A subsequent PR
will bump it to v2
